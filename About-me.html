                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Robert Neff. Im a softmore at University of Oregon studying a business major. When I'm not studying or going to class, I have a host of things that I love to do.
                    From playing videogames, playing guitar, listening to music, going on hikes and walks, or even just hanging out with friends, I try to do as much as possible. However, when I can, there is one thing I love above everything else, TRAVELING!

                </p>
                
                <p>
                    From Tokyo, Japan, to the beautful beaches of Hawaii, or to the streets of France, I have done it all. But with all these cool locations and travels, I thought it would be a good idea to share it on something. 
                    I realized a blog would be good, so for all you readers and fans, I have decided to create a blog, where you can see my newest travels, and can catch up with what I'm doing at the moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From summer trips, to family trips to Tahoe, I'm doing it all, and you can come join me along for the ride.
                </p>
